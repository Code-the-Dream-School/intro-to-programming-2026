# Lesson 11: Final Project

## Intro to Programming

### Code the Dream

---

# Today's Game Plan

| Section | Time |
|---------|------|
| Warm-Up | 5 min |
| Review | 10-15 min |
| Work Time | 20-25 min |
| Wrap-Up | 5 min |

<!--
This session is different from the others — it's focused on
review, troubleshooting, and work time. Students should be
finishing their portfolio and Open API pages.
-->

---

# Warm-Up (5 min)

**Zoom chat:**

What's one thing you've built in this course that you're proud of?

<!--
Celebrate their progress! This is the last session.
Let as many students share as time allows.
-->

# Where We've Been

Over the past 10 weeks, you've learned:

- **JavaScript** — variables, loops, arrays, objects, functions, algorithms, callbacks
- **HTML** — structure, elements, forms
- **CSS** — styling, box model, flexbox
- **The DOM** — selecting, creating, and manipulating elements
- **Async & Fetch** — pulling real data from APIs
- **Git & GitHub** — version control, branches, pull requests

> That's a lot. Give yourselves some credit!

---

# Final Project: Two Parts

**1. Portfolio Page** (index.html)
- About, Experience, Skills, Projects, Leave a Message
- JavaScript: footer, skills list, form handling, GitHub repos
- CSS: styled and responsive layout

**2. Open API Page** (openapi.html)
- 2 API endpoints with navigation between them
- Separate HTML, CSS, and JS files
- Linked from your portfolio

---

# Portfolio Rubric — Key Checklist

**HTML:** Boilerplate, nav with internal links, all sections

**JavaScript:**
- Footer with copyright year (dynamic)
- Skills list from an array
- Message form with submit handling + remove buttons
- GitHub repos fetched and displayed

**CSS:** Flexbox for layout, effective styling

> Review the full rubric in your lesson materials!

---

# Open API Rubric — Key Checklist

- Linked from portfolio nav + nav back to portfolio
- **2 separate GET requests** (one per endpoint)
- Navigation between the two data views
- Error handling
- Clean code and effective styling

---

# Common Issues — Let's Troubleshoot

**Zoom poll or chat:** Where are you getting stuck?

- A) HTML structure
- B) CSS layout / flexbox
- C) JavaScript DOM manipulation
- D) Fetch / API calls
- E) Git / pushing to GitHub
- F) I'm in good shape!

<!--
Use the responses to guide the rest of the session. Focus on
the areas where students need the most help. You can do a
quick demo, debug a student's code, or use breakout rooms.
-->

---

# Tips for Finishing Strong

1. **Start with the rubric** — check off items as you go
2. **Don't get stuck on styling** — get the functionality working first
3. **Test in the browser** frequently — small changes, save, refresh
4. **Use DevTools** — Console for JS errors, Elements for CSS
5. **Ask for help** — Slack, office hours, your mentor!

---

# Work Time (20-25 min)

Use this time to work on your final project.

**Your mentor is here to help!**

- Unmute or use the chat to ask questions
- Share your screen if you need debugging help
- Use breakout rooms for 1-on-1 support

<!--
Circulate and check in with each student if possible.
Prioritize students who are behind or stuck.
Encourage students who are done to help their peers.
-->

---

# Project Demo Prep

You'll record a **3-5 minute video** of your project:

1. Scroll through your **portfolio** to show the design
2. **Demo the message form** — submit, show, remove
3. Switch to your **Open API page**
4. Show **both endpoints** working
5. Share the **most challenging part** and what you enjoyed most

> You can record with Zoom, screen recording, or Loom.
