# Open API Rubric

There is a lot of freedom on this page to be creative.  You may structure and style this page any way you would like.  It must meet the following minimal requirements.

## STRUCTURE:
 - [ ] Linked to the page from the portfolio nav bar
 - [ ] Nav bar that allows navigation back to the portfolio page
 - [ ] An HTML document for the page
 - [ ] A CSS document to style the HTML page
 - [ ] A JavaScript file that retrieves data from one of several public API sources to display the data on your HTML page

## CONTENT:
 - [ ] Display the data for at least 2 endpoints in the API
 - [ ] Include navigation (e.g. button or link) from each type of data to the other (For Example: if using the weather app, one navigation button/link should display the temperature details and the second navigation button/link should display the weather condition)
 - [ ] Issue new GET requests each time the user click a navigation link, meaning you should have 2 GET requests - one for each navigation, that requests only the needed information (Example: if using the weather app, clicking temperature navigation link should pull only data that allows user to see temperatures and clicking conditions navigation link should pull only data that allows user to see weather conditions)

## FUNCTIONALITY:
 - [ ] Code runs without issues by following the instructions in the README file
 - [ ] Navigation between the different endpoints behaves properly and is not slowed down by requesting more data than needs to be displayed (this is the reason for the 2 separate GET requests)
 - [ ] Code is readable and well structured
 - [ ] If applicable, error cases are appropriately handled
 - [ ] Styling is effective (example: font-sizes are not too small or large, colors are not too dark/light to be easily seen, etc.)
