Naming and style conventions are a set of widely accepted guidelines for naming variables, functions, classes and other identifiers. They are used to improve code readability and maintainability.

It is also important to consider the readability of your code when you are naming variables and functions. Avoid abbreviations unless they are commonly known.  
'i' and 'j' are widely used as loop counters and array indices.

Well-named variables help both the original developer and others understand what the code is doing without needing to decipher vague or cryptic labels. For example, a variable named totalPrice is far more informative than one named tp, instantly conveying its purpose. Descriptive names reduce confusion, make debugging easier, and allow for more efficient collaboration among a team of developers.
