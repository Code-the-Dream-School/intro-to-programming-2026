# Lesson 01 - Debugging Basics (JavaScript)
Basic techniques to find and fix errors in JavaScript code.

Debugging is extremely important because it helps **catch errors early**, improves code reliability, and helps in understanding code flow. 

When writing code, it is possible for code to be prone to many errors:  
- **Syntax errors** occur when you have typos in code or miss brackets.  
- **Reference errors** occur when you refer to undefined variables.  
- **Type errors** occur when you use incorrect operations on values.  
- **Logical errors** happen when code runs but produces the wrong results.

In order to successfully debug, there are many tools we can utilize:  
- **console.log()** can be used for checking variable values and program flow.  
- **console.error()** allows us to see the error messages.  
- **debugger;** allows us to pause code execution and inspect variables.

We should also follow tips and best practices for debugging:  
- Test code incrementally because managing small chunks is easier than debugging the entire code at once.  
- Use descriptive variable names for easier debugging.  
- Comment out parts of code to isolate problems.  
- Read error messages carefully and try to understand what they indicate.

### Examples

**Example 1: Checking variable values**
```javascript
let firstName = "Rubaina";
let lastName = "Roshan";
let fullName = firstName + lastName; // Forgot the space

// Debugging output
console.log("Full Name:", fullName); // Output will show the missing space
