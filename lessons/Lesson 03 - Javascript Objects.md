# Continuing with Git - Commit and Push Updates

Last week, we cloned our repository to our local machine.

This week, we are going to make some changes in our repository, commit them and push them back to our remote repository.  

**TODO - Video - Commit and Push Updates**

The following slides show the steps involved in using Git and Github.  Pay attention to where files are located in each step - either on your local machine or remote in Github.
