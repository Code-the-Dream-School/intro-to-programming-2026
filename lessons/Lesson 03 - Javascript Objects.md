# Continuing with Git - Commit and Push Updates

Last week, we cloned our repository to our local machine.

This week, we are going to make some changes in our repository, commit them and push them back to our remote repository.  

### Watch this video on how to make changes in your repository: ###
[Making Changes in Your Repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqn8Ws_jzmg&list=PLYvE5YXWTfw88MpcXKPmPPJtqm_gQ3ex8&index=4)

## Assignment - Making changes in our repository
   - [ ] Navigate into the directory you cloned last week by typing `cd <name-classname>` in the terminal where the <name-classname> portion is the name of your repository.
   - [ ] Create a new local branch to house just the work you'll do for this assignment by running `git checkout -b lesson-3` in the terminal
   - [ ] You can run `git status` or `git branch --show-current` to verify that you are currently working in the correct branch.
   - [ ] Open the README.md file in your code editor and add your full name.
   - [ ] Create a new file in your project directory (same level as your README.md file) and title it `index.html`
   - [ ] Check the status of the changes you just made (editing the readme.md file and making a new index.html file) by running `git status` in your terminal
   - [ ] Stage all your changes for commit by running `git add .` in your terminal
   - [ ] Run `git status` again to see how things have changed.  You should get a response indicating changes staged for commit.
   - [ ] Create a commit message for reference.  Run `git commit -m "my first commit"`
   - [ ] Push these changes to your GitHub repository from your local computer by running `git push origin lesson-3`
   - [ ] **NOTE:** if you get a "fatal: The current branch..." error message.  READ the message and follow the instructions in that message to confirm that you push your work to your GitHub account.

## Git / GitHub Workflow
The following image shows the steps involved in using Git and GitHub.  Pay attention to where files are located in each step - either on your local machine or remote in GitHub.  
We will work on the entire workflow in pieces over Lessons 2, 3 and 4.
