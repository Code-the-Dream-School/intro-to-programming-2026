# JavaScript Basics

**You can _either_ use the written Odin Project lessons _or_ the video lessons in Scrimba. You can do both if you have them time and want to, but using just one or the other will teach what is needed to complete the coding assignments.**

For the Odin Project, Go to each link in this list and read through the content on that page. If there are links you are redirected to as you read/work through the content, follow those links as well and read the content there too.

# Software Repositories

A software repository, often called a "repo", is a centralized storage location for code and related files used in software development. Software repositories allows developers to track changes to code, revert to previous versions of code and merge different branches of development.

Software repositories are especially important on projects being developed by a software team where multiple people are working on the same code base. This is true for the majority of software projects.

There are many cloud based software repositories. In this class we will use GitHub which is based on git which is a distributed version control system. We will learn more about git in lesson 2.

### Watch this video on how to create a new GitHub Repository: ###

## Assignment - Create a New GitHub Repository
Create a new repository in your GitHub account by following these steps:

- [ ] Go to your GitHub page and click the Repositories tab
- [ ] Click the green "New" button in the top right
- [ ] Fill in the fields to give your repository a name (use your name-**_classname_** as the name example: `maria-santiago-jupiter`) and description (example: portfolio project for Intro to Programming course with Code the Dream)
- [ ] Be sure PUBLIC is selected and check the "Initialize this repository with: Add a README file" check box.
- [ ] Click "Create Repository"
- [ ] When you submit your assignment this week, please copy and paste the link to the repository you created in the "second link to assignment" field.

## Git / GitHub Workflow
The following image shows the entire workflow involved in using Git and GitHub.  Pay attention to where files are located in each step - either on your local machine or remote in GitHub.  

In this lesson, we have completed the portion of the workflow outlined with the red dashed line. We will work on the remaining workflow in Lessons 2, 3 and 4.
