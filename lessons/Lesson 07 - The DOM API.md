# Document Object Model (DOM)

The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.  It is a programming interface that allows you to interact with elements on the web page programmatically. It represents the structure of an HTML document as a hierarchical tree of objects, allowing developers to access, modify, and manipulate web page content and structure using scripting languages like JavaScript. 

### What the DOM does:
- **Represents structure:**
It organizes the document's elements (like tags) and content into a tree-like hierarchy, with each element, text, or comment being a "node". 
- **Enables manipulation:**
With the DOM, JavaScript can find specific elements, change their content, add new elements, remove existing ones, or modify their attributes and styling. 
- **Facilitates interactivity:**
By allowing dynamic changes to a web page without needing to reload the entire page, the DOM is essential for features like drop-down menus, search suggestions, and other interactive web experiences.
