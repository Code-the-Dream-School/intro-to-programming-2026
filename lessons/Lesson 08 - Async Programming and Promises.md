## Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Code

### Synchronous Code

- **Blocking execution:** In synchronous code, tasks are executed sequentially. Each operation must complete before the next one can begin.
- **Real life examples:** Phones calls, face to face conversation
- **Predictable flow:** The order of execution is clear and straightforward, making it easier to reason about and debug.
- **Predictability:** The sequential nature of sync operations ensures that tasks are executed in a predictable order, which can be important for tasks requiring strict sequencing.
- **Inefficiency with I/O Operations:** Sync programming can be inefficient for I/O-bound tasks, as operations like file reading or network requests can block the entire thread until completion.

### Asynchronous Code
- **Non-blocking execution:** Asynchronous code allows a program to initiate a task and continue executing other code without waiting for the initiated task to complete.
- **Real life examples:** Text Messages, Email
- **Improved responsiveness:** This is crucial for applications where responsiveness is key, such as web servers handling multiple user requests or user interfaces that need to remain interactive during long operations.
- **Complexity:** Asynchronous code can be more complex to write and debug due to the non-linear flow of execution and the need for mechanisms like callbacks, promises, or async/await keywords to manage results.

## Promises

We talked about callbacks in lesson 4.  There are some disadvanatages to callbacks.  Promises are another way to manage asynchronous operations by providing a cleaner way to handle errors and chain multiple asynchronous steps, thereby avoiding the complexity of nested callbacks - often referred to as "callback hell".

- **Callbacks** are functions passed to other functions to be executed later
- **Promises** are objects representing the eventual success or failure of an asynchronouse operation with methods for handling these outcomes.  They are called *promises* because they guarantee that an asynchronous operation, which has not yet completed, will eventaully produce a value or a reason for its failure.  A promise is a placeholder object for a result that is not yet available.

It's important to understand the concept of promises, but we won't be creating them in this lesson.  They are the basis for the fetch API which we will learn about in the next lesson.
