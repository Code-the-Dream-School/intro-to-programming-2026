This week we are going to look at algorithms.  An algorithm sounds like it might be something hard and complex, but it really is just a set of steps that you are going to code in order to accomplish an end goal. An algorithm is just a set of step-by-step instructions written in Javascript to solve a specific problem or performa  task.

This lesson is going to utilize a lot what you have already learned in order to accomplish specific tasks.
