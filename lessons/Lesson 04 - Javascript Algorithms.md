## **Algorithms**

This week we are going to look at algorithms. An algorithm sounds like it might be something hard and complex, but it really is just a set of steps that you are going to code in order to accomplish an end goal - a set of step-by-step instructions to solve a specific problem or perform a task.

Here is a non-coding explanation of algorithms, which can be a helpful way to think about some of the problems we are trying to solve.

## **Pseudocode**

As the problems you are trying to solve become more complex, it can be helpful to write the steps of your program down in plain language instead of jumping straight to code. Even experienced developers do this as a way of thinking about the problem they are trying to solve without having to drill down into the specifics of how to code it.

Pseudocode will not compile or run, but can be made as a set of comments with code filled in later in the appropriate places. It is also helpful that the pseudocode can simply become the comments for your code once it is written.

Let's take the simple example of a tip calculator which will be one of your questions for assignment 4.

```jsx
// We know it's a function and that it takes 2 parameters, so we'll just go ahead and code that part
function tipCalculator(billTotal, tipPercentage) {
  // Check the parameters and make sure they are valid
  // Multiply the total by the tip percentage which gives us the tip
  // Add the tip to the bill total to get the final amount paid
  // Return the final amount paid
}
```

## **Callbacks**

Callbacks are functions that you provide to another function or system to be executed when a certain condition or event occurs. They are a way of saying, "Hey, when this thing happens, do this specific task.‚Äù

Here is some additional information on callbacks:
https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_callback.asp

Imagine you have a button on a website, and you want something to happen when the button is clicked. You could create a callback function that specifies what should happen when the button is clicked. This callback function is then associated with the button.

```jsx
// A function that adds two numbers and uses a callback to return the result
function addNumbers(a, b, callback) {
  const result = a + b;
  callback(result);
}

// Define a callback function to handle the result
function handleResult(result) {
  console.log("The result is: " + result);
}

// Call the addNumbers function with a callback
addNumbers(5, 3, handleResult);
```

In this example, the **`addNumbers`** function takes two numbers **`a`** and **`b`**, adds them together, and then calls a provided **`callback`** function with the result. The **`handleResult`** function is the callback, and it prints the result to the console.

Callbacks are a versatile and powerful concept in programming, and they can be used in various scenarios. Here are some common situations where callbacks are useful:

1. **Asynchronous Operations:** Callbacks are often used with asynchronous operations, like making network requests, reading files, or interacting with databases. They allow you to specify what should happen when the operation is completed without blocking the rest of your program.
2. **Event Handling:** In user interfaces, callbacks are used to respond to user interactions such as button clicks, mouse movements, or keyboard input. You define a callback function that gets triggered when the event occurs.
3. **Modular and Reusable Code:** Callbacks make it easier to write modular and reusable code. You can create functions that accept callbacks to perform specific tasks, allowing you to reuse those functions with different behaviors depending on the callback provided.
4. **Iterations and Loops:** Callbacks can be used in iterations and loops to execute a function for each element in a collection, like an array or a list. This is known as "callback-based iteration."
5. **Promises and Promisified Code:** In JavaScript, promises often work with callbacks to handle asynchronous tasks more cleanly. Promises provide a structured way to handle callbacks and make asynchronous code easier to read and maintain.

Overall, callbacks are a fundamental building block in software development, enabling you to define what should happen when a particular event or operation occurs, making your code more flexible, modular, and responsive.

Don't worry if each of these uses doesn't make complete sense yet. It's just helpful to become familiar with some of the terminology. We will be covering callbacks again in some of the later lessons.
