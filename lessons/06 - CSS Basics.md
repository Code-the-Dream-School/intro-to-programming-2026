# 6.1 Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

*Cascading Style Sheets*, or CSS, is a style sheet language that was created to supplement HTML. As a *style sheet language*, CSS is the code that explains how a markup language, like HTML, should be presented. When used alongside HTML on a web page, CSS can add a variety of formatting, design, and style details.

## AI Learning Prompt: Predict-then-Check

Study this CSS code without running it:

```css
p {
  color: blue;
}
.red-text {
  color: red;
}
```

If you have an HTML element `<p class="red-text">Hello World</p>`:

1. Predict what color the text "Hello World" will be.
2. Explain to an AI chatbot why you think that specific color will appear (Hint: look up "CSS Specificity" or "The Cascade").
3. Ask: "Is my reasoning about how CSS determines which style 'wins' correct?".
4. Test the code in a text editor to see if your prediction was right.
