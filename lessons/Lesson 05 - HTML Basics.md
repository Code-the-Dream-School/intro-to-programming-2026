### HTML

*Hypertext Markup Language (created in 1989)*, commonly called *HTML*, is a programming language that is used to create the structure of a web page. The basic idea of HTML is that the brackets < > surrounding the code of a web page tell the web browser what information it's working with.

At its core, hypertext is digital text that can link to other places, such as one website connecting to another. HTML, a markup language, uses tags like **`<head>`** and **`<body>`** to structure web content in a way that browsers can display. Unlike technical programming code, HTML uses human-readable words, making it user-friendly for web content creation.

HTML is the foundational component of a website adding these elements to a web page:

- Text: Words and written content
- Media: Images, videos, and other visual or auditory elements
- Links: Clickable paths to other places, like other websites
- Containers: Elements that are used to give web pages structure for layout purposes

### Tags vs Elements

An HTML element is often made up of two **_tags_**: an _opening tag_ and a _closing tag_ (sometimes called a _begin tag_ and an _end tag_, respectively). The opening tag begins the HTML element, and it's enclosed in brackets <>.

An HTML **_element_** consists of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag (such as `<h1>` and `</h1>`). The closing tag will always have a /, which signifies the end of an element. HTML text can be grouped into headings or paragraphs.

# Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).  IDEs are helpful programs that combine several tools (a text editor, the command line/terminal, file organization, and more) into one program.  If you aren't currently using an IDE of your own preference, you should watch the video below and install Visual Studio Code and suggested extensions in the video before you start this week's assignment.
