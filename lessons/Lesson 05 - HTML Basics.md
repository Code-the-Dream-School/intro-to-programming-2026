### HTML

*Hypertext Markup Language (created in 1989)*, commonly called *HTML*, is a programming language that is used to create the structure of a web page. The basic idea of HTML is that the brackets < > surrounding the code of a web page tell the web browser what information it's working with.

At its core, hypertext is digital text that can link to other places, such as one website connecting to another. HTML, a markup language, uses tags like **`<head>`** and **`<body>`** to structure web content in a way that browsers can display. Unlike technical programming code, HTML uses human-readable words, making it user-friendly for web content creation.

HTML is the foundational component of a website adding these elements to a web page:

- Text: Words and written content
- Media: Images, videos, and other visual or auditory elements
- Links: Clickable paths to other places, like other websites
- Containers: Elements that are used to give web pages structure for layout purposes

### Tags vs Elements

HTML **_elements_** are the basic building blocks of a webpage. Each HTML element represents a different type of content (such as a link, image, heading, list, paragraph, etc.). Each HTML element is represented using 1 or 2 tags.

An HTML **_tag_** is how we code an HTML element. All tags use **brackets** <>. Some HTML elements are represented by writing only 1 tag. For example, this 1 tag represents an image element in HTML:

```html
<img src="myPhoto.jpg" alt="This Is My Photo">
```

Some HTML elements need 2 tags: an _opening tag_ and a _closing tag_ (sometimes called a _begin tag_ and an _end tag_, respectively). Here are some examples:

```html
<p>This is my paragraph's content. Notice the opening tag is a bit different from the closing tag.</p>
```

In the HTML element above, notice that it has an opening tag: `<p>`. The closing tag for this element is very similar to its opening tag, but it has a / in it: `</p>`  Here are more examples of elements with 2 tags:

```html
<h1>Here is a heading type of HTML element.</h1>

<div class='mySpecialClassName'>Some tags have additional attributes. Notice the end tag remains simple. The end tag doesn't have the extra attributes of the begin tag.</div>
```

For html elements which require 2 tags, the end tag will look very similar to the begin tag. Except, the end tag will have the `/` character in it.


# Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).  IDEs are helpful programs that combine several tools (a text editor, the command line/terminal, file organization, and more) into one program.  If you aren't currently using an IDE of your own preference, you should watch the video below and install Visual Studio Code and suggested extensions in the video before you start this week's assignment.
