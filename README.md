# WIKI
For any additional markdown files to be linked into the main lessons, we are putting that information in the GitHub wiki.  
The files will still be managed in the GitHub repo, but will be copied into the wiki upon updates.  

When adding new files, make sure to add them by editing the **_Sidebar** file in the wiki (select edit on the sidebar panel) and adding the file there.
