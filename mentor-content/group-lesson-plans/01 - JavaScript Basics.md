### Lesson 1: Group Mentor Guide

| Lesson # | Title | Learning Objective |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1 | JavaScript Basics and Functions | Students will understand variable declaration, data types, string manipulation, conditionals, function definition/invocation, and basic debugging techniques. |

#### Lesson Structure
##### Explore v. Apply Formats
*   **Explore practice** focuses on the new concepts taught each week, placing special emphasis on the “why” and “how” of each new concept.
*   **Apply practice** lets students engage in hands-on practice and assignment support.

##### Sample timing for a 1-hour session
| Time | Activity |
| ------ | ------ |
| 0:00-0:10 | Warm Up |
| 0:10-0:30 | Explore practice |
| 0:30-0:50 | Apply practice |
| 0:50-1:00 | Wrap-up and final questions |

##### Engagement Strategies
If students are quiet or feel unsure about how to engage, try these activities or discussion prompts to build student confidence:
*   **"Fix the Bug" Challenge:** Present a simple code snippet with a common error, such as a missing bracket (syntax error) or a variable named `tp` instead of `totalPrice`, and ask students to identify the issue.
*   **Discussion Prompt:** "Why is it better to use `const` for a value like Pi ($3.14$) instead of `let`? What happens if we try to re-assign a constant?".

#### Lesson Content
##### Warm Up (5-10 minutes)
Choose one:
###### Relationship Building
*   What is one thing you hope to build once you master JavaScript?.
*   If you could create a "placeholder" (parameter) for any real-world object today, what would it be?.

###### Check for Understanding
*   What are the three keywords used to declare variables in JavaScript, and which one should we generally avoid?.
*   How do you open the **Developer Tools** and **Console** in your web browser to see your code's output?.

##### Explore Practice
*   **The "Why" of Functions:** Discuss how functions act as "storage containers" or "bundles" for code that can be reused over and over again without rewriting it.
*   **Data Type Deep Dive:** Review the **eight data types** and the power of **template literals** (backticks) for embedding variables directly into strings.
*   **Comparison & Logic:** Explore how **logical operators** (and, or, not) help a computer make decisions within an `if/else` statement.

##### Apply Practice
*   **Live Coding:** Have students write a function called `add7` that takes a number and returns that number + 7, testing it with `console.log()`.
*   **String Manipulation:** Challenge the group to write the `capitalize` function, which ensures only the first letter of a string is uppercase regardless of how it was originally typed.
*   **Debugging Session:** Use `console.log()` to inspect variable values in a provided script to find a "logic error," such as a missing space between a first and last name.

##### Wrap-Up
*   Make sure you have taken attendance! Easy ways to collect attendance:
    *   Create a Google poll collecting student names and paste the link the chat.
    *   Post in Slack asking students to react if they attended the session.
    *   Take a screenshot of the Zoom participant list.
*   **Final Knowledge Check:** Can everyone name one **falsy** value in JavaScript?.
*   Submit the mentor session report form.
