# How to Use CTD's Mentor Templates

Our mentor session templates are designed to help mentors plan activities for mentor sessions. These aren't strict lesson plans – think of them as banks of activities you can choose to incorporate into your lessons.

There are three types of plans per week:
1. **Group sessions - Apply**: introduce new concepts and ideas, prompt discussion on the lesson topics, and help students connect new topics to what they’ve been learning.
2. **Group sessions - Explore**: focus on the weekly coding assignment or exercises and help them practice what they’re learning or get unstuck.
3. **1:1 Sessions**: help by-appointment mentors prepare for any scheduled 1:1 sessions that week.

Our lessons use the **gradual release** framework, which transfers agency from the mentor to the student over the course of a lesson. The key idea here is that **students, not mentors, should do most of the thinking**. Ideally, we don't want mentors lecturing from a slide deck for an hour (though lectures are sometimes appropriate). Instead, we want students to take ownership of their learning. The activities in these lesson templates are great starter ideas for getting students to take agency. As you practice, you'll feel more comfortable giving control to students.

### A few reminders for quality mentor sessions:

1. **Be reliable.** Show up on time, communicate if you have to cancel or reschedule your lesson. If you repeatedly miss sessions or show up late, students will stop attending your sessions.
2. **Celebrate trial and error.** We want students to feel comfortable making mistakes, trying out new approaches, and feeling uncertain. Mentors have a powerful role giving students the freedom to experiment and learn on their own.
3. **Incorporate wait time.** Research shows that people need 5-10 seconds to respond after they've been asked a specific question or asked if they have any questions. On Zoom, this might be even longer since students have to unmute or write in the chat. Let 10 seconds of silence pass (literally - count them in your head!) after you ask for questions or ask a specific question. Only after this wait time should you move on.
4. **"Warm-Call" on quiet students.** Cold-calling ("Jasmine, what do you think of this function?") can be intimidating for students. But we should still expect students to participate, and quiet students sometimes need a nudge. Try something like this instead: "Jasmine, I'd love to hear from you today. I'm going to go over this function, then ask you what you think of it." This gives students time to prepare, but also lets them know that they'll be expected to participate.
5. **Use the full range of Zoom tools.** Teaching online is hard and can feel awkward, but it also gives us some unique tools. Don't be afraid to try out breakout rooms, interactive screen share, polls, and a range of other tools that let you take advantage of Zoom's infrastructure. Make sure to always have chat open - many students prefer to participate there.
