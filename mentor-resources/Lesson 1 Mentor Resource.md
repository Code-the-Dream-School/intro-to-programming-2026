## Lesson Overview
This is the first week of the course. Students are learning the fundamentals of JavaScript: variables, data types, conditionals, and functions. They also get an introduction to problem-solving strategies, debugging basics, naming conventions, and software repositories (GitHub). The assignment asks students to practice declaring variables, using string methods, writing conditionals, and creating simple functions. Students also create their first GitHub repository this week.

This lesson sets the foundation for everything that follows. Students who build strong habits around variable naming, console logging, and debugging this week will have a much easier time in later lessons.

## Group Mentor Sessions

### Explore Session

**Warm-Up** (5-10 minutes)
- Since this is the first week, focus on rapport-building. Ask students to introduce themselves: name, where they're from, and one thing they're hoping to learn in this course.
- Alternatively, ask: "Have you ever tried to explain how to do something simple (like making a sandwich) in exact, step-by-step instructions? What made it hard?"

**I Do** (~15 minutes)
- Give a brief overview of what JavaScript is and where it runs (browsers, Node.js).
- Demo declaring variables with `let` and `const` in a browser console or code editor. Show the difference between strings, numbers, and booleans.
- Walk through a simple `if/else` statement. Emphasize reading code from top to bottom.

**We Do** (15-20 minutes)
- Present a short code snippet with a bug (e.g., using `=` instead of `===` in a conditional, or referencing an undeclared variable) and ask students to identify what's wrong.
- Discussion prompt: "Why do you think JavaScript has both `let` and `const`? When might you choose one over the other?"
- If using breakout rooms: have each group write pseudocode for a simple problem (e.g., "Write the steps to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero"). Rotate between rooms to check in and prompt quiet groups with questions like "What's your first step?"

**You Do** (15-20 minutes)
- Have students open their browser console (or code editor) and try:
  1. Declare a variable with their name and console.log it.
  2. Write a conditional that checks if a number is greater than 10.
  3. Write a function that takes a name and returns a greeting string.
- Students can share their screen to show what they came up with, or report back from breakout rooms.

**Wrap-Up** (5-10 minutes)
- Ask: "What is one thing you learned today that you didn't know before?"
- Preview next week: loops and arrays — the tools for doing things repeatedly and working with collections of data.
- Remind students to reach out on Slack if they get stuck on the assignment.

### Apply Session

**Warm-Up** (5-10 minutes)
- Ask: "What part of the assignment felt most straightforward so far? What part felt confusing?"
- Or pose a quick question: "What does `console.log` do, and why is it useful?"

**I Do** (~15 minutes)
- Pull up the assignment and walk through Q1-Q2 to show the pattern: read the instructions (comments), write the code below, uncomment the console.log, and check the output.
- Demonstrate how to use `console.log` to check your work at each step.
- Briefly show how to create a GitHub repository (since that's part of this week's assignment).

**We Do** (15-20 minutes)
- Work through a question together, like Q4 (string concatenation). Have students suggest the code while you type. Ask questions like "What operator do we use to join strings together?" or "Has anyone tried template literals?"
- Walk through Q7 (conditionals) together, asking students to predict the output before running the code.

**You Do** (15-20 minutes)
- Give students time to work on the assignment questions they haven't completed yet. Circulate (or use breakout rooms) and answer questions.
- If a student is stuck, guide them with questions rather than giving the answer: "What data type is this variable? What does the question ask you to return?"

**Wrap-Up** (5-10 minutes)
- Ask: "Did anyone discover something surprising while working on the assignment?"
- Remind students about the GitHub repository setup if they haven't done it yet.
- Point ahead: next week they'll learn loops and arrays, which will let them solve more complex problems.

## 1:1 Session Guide

- **Build rapport**: This is the first week, so spend some time getting to know the student. Ask about their background, why they signed up, and what they're hoping to get out of the course.
- **Check understanding**: Ask the student to explain what a variable is in their own words, or to talk you through one of the assignment questions they've completed.
- **Encourage independence**: If a student asks "Is this right?", redirect with "What does your console.log show? Does the output match what the question is asking for?"
- **Goal-setting**: Help the student set a small goal for the week, like "Complete through Q10 by Wednesday" or "Set up my GitHub repository before next session."
- **Common sticking points this week**:
  - Confusing `=` (assignment) with `===` (comparison)
  - Forgetting to use `return` in functions
  - String concatenation syntax (especially mixing `+` with template literals)
  - Getting the GitHub repository created and understanding what it's for
