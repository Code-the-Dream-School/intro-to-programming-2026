# How to Use These Slides

Our base slides are intentionally short overviews of the lesson content - use these in the first ~15-20 minutes of your mentor session (the "I Do" portion). They're written in markdown, so they are easy for you to adapt to your needs.

Two quick ways to edit and run the slides:
* Browser-based: https://demo.marpeditor.com/
* VS Code-based: install https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode
