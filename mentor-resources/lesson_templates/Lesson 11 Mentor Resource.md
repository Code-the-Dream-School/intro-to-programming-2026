# Lesson 11 Mentor Resource: Final Project

## Lesson Overview
This is the final week of the course. Students focus on finishing their portfolio and Open API pages, ensuring both meet the rubric requirements. They take a final assessment, record a 3-5 minute project demo video, and submit everything. There is no new lesson content — this week is all about polish, completion, and presentation.

This week is about celebration as much as it is about completion. Students have come a long way — from variables and `console.log` to a full portfolio site with API integrations. Mentors should help students feel confident and proud of their work while ensuring they meet the requirements to advance.

## Group Mentor Sessions

### Explore Session

**Warm-Up** (5-10 minutes)
- Ask: "What are you most proud of about your project? What was the hardest part of the course?"
- Or: "If you had one more week, what would you add to your portfolio?"

**I Do** (~15 minutes)
- Walk through both rubrics (portfolio and Open API) together as a group. Highlight the key requirements.
- Demo the project presentation format: walk through your own example or a sample portfolio showing each element the demo should cover:
  1. Scroll through the portfolio
  2. Demo the message form
  3. Navigate to the Open API page
  4. Show both API endpoints displaying data
  5. Navigate back
  6. Reflect on challenges and enjoyable parts
- Explain the recording options (Zoom, screen recording, Loom) and the YouTube upload process.

**We Do** (15-20 minutes)
- Rubric review activity: have students pair up and review each other's projects against the rubric. Each student should check their partner's work and identify anything that's missing.
- Discussion: "What are the most common things that might be missing? Let's make a checklist together."
- If using breakout rooms: have each group do a practice demo for each other with feedback. Rotate and ask "Is there anything the rubric requires that this project is missing?"

**You Do** (15-20 minutes)
- Give students focused work time to address any rubric gaps identified during the peer review.
- Students who are done can practice their demo presentation.

**Wrap-Up** (5-10 minutes)
- Celebrate: "You all started this course without knowing JavaScript. Now you've built a portfolio with API integrations. That's a huge accomplishment."
- Remind students of submission deadlines and the process for recording and uploading their demo.
- If applicable, share information about the next course options.

### Apply Session

**Warm-Up** (5-10 minutes)
- Ask: "How is everyone feeling about their project? What do you still need to finish?"
- Quick check: "Has everyone reviewed both rubrics?"

**I Do** (~15 minutes)
- Do a final walkthrough of common issues to check for:
  - Is the CSS file linked correctly?
  - Does the navigation work (all links jump to the correct sections)?
  - Does the form work (submit, display, remove)?
  - Is the GitHub repos fetch working?
  - Does the Open API page make 2 distinct calls and display data?
  - Is there a link between the portfolio and Open API page (both directions)?
- Show how to test the site in different browsers or screen sizes.

**We Do** (15-20 minutes)
- Open troubleshooting session: students share their screens and the group helps identify and fix remaining issues.
- Work through any common bugs (broken links, fetch errors, CSS layout issues).

**You Do** (15-20 minutes)
- Final work time. Students should be finishing up their projects and preparing to submit.
- Help students who are struggling with the recording or upload process.

**Wrap-Up** (5-10 minutes)
- Final celebration and encouragement. Ask students to share one thing they learned that they're excited about.
- Remind students of the submission process: merge open pull requests, submit the repo link, and upload the demo video.
- Wish them well and point them toward next steps in their coding journey.

## 1:1 Session Guide

- **Build rapport**: This is the last session. Celebrate the student's growth. Ask: "What's the biggest thing you learned in this course?"
- **Check understanding**: Do a rubric walk-through with the student. Open their portfolio and Open API page and check each requirement together.
- **Encourage independence**: For any missing pieces, guide the student to fix them rather than fixing them yourself. Ask: "Do you remember how we did this in Lesson 7?" or "What would you search for to find the answer?"
- **Goal-setting**: Help the student create a checklist of final tasks: fix any rubric gaps, merge pull requests, record the demo, upload to YouTube, submit.
- **Common sticking points this week**:
  - Missing rubric requirements: navigation not working, form submit not preventing default, missing copyright in footer
  - Open API page: one of the two API calls not working or not displaying
  - Recording the demo: students may be nervous or unsure how to screen record. Walk them through the options.
  - Merging pull requests: students may have forgotten to merge previous branches, leading to incomplete code on main
  - Students feeling anxious about the assessment: reassure them that it tests what they've already learned
